When a `git commit` is about to run, lint all staged YAML files.

```bash
staged=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep -E '\.ya?ml$' || true)
if [ -n "$staged" ]; then
  echo "--- pre-commit: yamllint on staged files ---"
  echo "$staged" | xargs yamllint -d relaxed
fi
```

Also enforced by the `pre-commit` framework via `.pre-commit-config.yaml` when the user commits directly (not through Claude).
